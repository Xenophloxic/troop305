# Troop 305 Website made with Flask
----------

<p>Using the Flask framework, I have creating a Web Application for Troop 305, where the future Webmaster does not need to worry about the back-end. Every text field, event, news letter, name, and image will be editable from an admin login</p>
----------
```
/login
```
Logs in a user
----------
```
/webmaster
```
Home for the webmaster
----------
```
and many others
```
This will be uploaded to [http://troop305.com](http://troop305.com)

All changes to the website are made by a POST form action.
