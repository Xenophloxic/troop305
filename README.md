# Troop 305 Website made with Flask

<p>Using the Flask framework, I have creating a Web Application for Troop 305, where the future Webmaster does not need to worry about the back-end. Every text field, event, news letter, name, and image will be editable from an admin login</p>
<br>
<code>
/login
</code><br>
Logs in a user
<br>
<code>
/webmaster
</code><br>
Home for the webmaster
<br>
<code>
and many others
</code><br>
This will be uploaded to [http://troop305.com](http://troop305.com)

All changes to the website are made by a POST form action.
